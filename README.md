# mr-finance

An agent with one tool (operonx-agents), served over HTTP. Built on [operonx](https://pypi.org/project/operonx/) and
`operonx-agents`.

`src/assistant/` is the feature: `ops.py` holds the agent's `word_count`
tool, `graph.py` the agent itself (`ASSISTANT`: its model, `llm:assistant`
from `resources.yaml`, its instructions, tools and limits). `app/main.py`
serves it with `agent_service`. The tests run it on a scripted model
(`operonx.agents.testing`).

## Run

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest          # offline: the tests drive the agent with a scripted model
cp .env.example .env   # then set LLM_API_KEY (and LLM_BASE_URL / LLM_MODEL if not OpenAI)
```

## Serve

```bash
uv run operonx serve --list   # what would listen, and where
uv run operonx serve          # POST /ask on :8000 (PORT overrides)
curl -s localhost:8000/ask -d '{"input": "How many words are in: to be or not to be?"}'
curl -sN localhost:8000/ask -H 'accept: text/event-stream' -d '{"input": "hi"}'   # its events
```

A reply has `status` (`completed`, `interrupted`, `limit`, `blocked`,
`failed`), `output` and `run_id`. A run that waits for a human ends
`interrupted` with its `interruptions`; answer them with
`POST /ask/resume {"run_id": ..., "approvals": {"<id>": "approve"}}`
(or `"deny"`, or `{"deny": "<reason>"}`). The model must support tool
calling (an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that honours `tools`).

## Grow it

A new tool is one more `@tool` in `ops.py` and one more entry in the
agent's `tools`. A new feature is a new folder under `src/` with its own
`graph.py` and `ops.py`, and one more `Service` (or `Job`) in
`app/main.py`. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.operonx/guide/README.md` (agents:
`agents/01-agents.md`) first.
